## Project Step 18 - Final Presentation(Product Release / Project Presentation)
### This is the starting point for your presentation. 

### Describe project experience including each phase of the SDLC and the project artifacts (design documents, requirements trace, test reports...) code and architecture walk-through
### product demonstration
lessons learned:
1. what did you do right?
<p><b><ul>Pages folder</b> Contains Razor pages and supporting files. </ul>
  <ul>Each Razor page is a pair of files:</ul>
  <ul>A .cshtml file that has HTML markup with C# code using Razor syntax.</ul>
  <ul>A .cshtml.cs file that has C# code that handles page events.Supporting files have names that begin with an underscore. </ul>
  <ul>For example, the _Layout.cshtml file configures UI elements common to all pages. </ul>
  <ul>This file sets up the navigation menu at the top of the page and the copyright notice at the bottom of the page.</ul></p>
<p><b>wwwroot folder</b> Contains static assets, like HTML files, JavaScript files, and CSS files.</p>
<p><b>appsettings.json</b> Contains configuration data, like connection strings. </p>
<p><b>Program.cs</b> Contains the entry point for the app. </p>
<p><b>Startup.cs</b> Contains code that configures app behavior. </p>
